RhesusLncRNA

This repository contains the data and code for the literature "Annotation, and functional analysis of spatiotemporal- and sex-related lncRNA expression in primate brain". To have an overview of the data in the literature, we uploaded the modules of lncRNAs and mRNAs by WGCNA analysis, including the detail information of gene expression level in each module. The co-expression between lncRNAs and mRNAs were also uploaded.

At the same time, The code that was used to generate the result was also uploaded. All code was written in the R or Perl programming language. WGCNA program was written in R, and co-expression program was written in Perl.
